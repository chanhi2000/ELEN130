__EXAMPLE: BRANCHING__

### (a)
- What is the ouput to the system below?

![fig04a](ex02/ex02-fig04a.png)

$$
y[n]=x[n-1]+2x[n]
$$
> __NOTE__: the branching node is not like current, $$x[n]$$ doesn’t “split” evenly between the two branches—it is a duplicate copy that continues on to the unit delay box and an identical copy that goes to the multiplier.

### (b)
- What is the ouput $$y[n]$$ of the system below?

![fig04b](ex02/ex02-fig04b.png)

$$
y[n]=\propto_1x[n]+\propto_2x[n-1]+\propto_3x[n-2]+\propto_4x[n-3]
$$
