__EXAMPLE: RECONSTRUCTION__

All three signals above ended with $$\cos{\left(\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)n\right)}$$
- We originally replaced $$t$$ with $$nT$$
- so, to go back, we can replace $$n$$ with $$\tfrac{t}{T}=tf_T$$.
- For the three cases, the reconstructor is only told of the sampling frequency:
