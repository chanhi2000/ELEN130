__EXAMPLE: SAMPLING AT RECONSTRUCTED FREQUENCIES__

$$
\begin{align*}
g_1(t)&=\cos{(2\pi{t})}\\
g_2(t)&=\cos{(6\pi{t})}\\
\end{align*}
$$
Plot these and sample each at $$4\:\text{Hz}$$
![fig02](ex04-fig02.png)

> __NOTE__: The point of this exercise is to
see that the samples at $$4\:\text{Hz}$$ are identical for these two signals. There are an infinite number of signals that would result in the same sample

$$
\left\{\begin{matrix}
\underset{\text{normalized digital frequency}}{v_0=\frac{{f}_0}{f_T}\:\left[\tfrac{\text{cycles}}{\text{sec}}\right]}\\
\underset{\text{normalized digital angular frequency}}{\omega_0=\frac{2\pi\Omega_0}{\Omega_T}\:\left[\tfrac{\text{radians}}{\text{sec}}\right]}&
\end{matrix}\right\}
$$
