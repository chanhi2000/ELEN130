__EXAMPLE: IMPULSE RESPONSE__

- What is the impulse response of this system
$$
y[n]=x[n]+0.5x[n-1]
$$
- What is the impulse response of this system
$$
y[n]=x[n]+0.5y[n-1]
$$
- What is the impulse response of the accumulator?


## 2
__EXAMPLE: SOLVING THE LCCDE__

Given
$$
y[n]+y[n-1]-6y[n-2]=x[n]
$$
We are interested in knowing the closed solution for input $$x[n]=8\mu[n]$$ with initial conditions: $$y[-1]=y[-2]=1$$. Find the complementary solution, $$y_c[n]$$ by assuming it has the form $$\lambda^n$$.
