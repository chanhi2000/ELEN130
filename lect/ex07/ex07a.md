__EXAMPLE: SAMPLING AND RECONSTRUCTION__

At what rate can we sample the following signals (whose spectra are shown) and still get perfect reconstruction? State any assumptions.

### 1.
- Sample at $$4\:\text{kHz$}$$ in both cases... 
- Spectral inversion occurs on the RIGHT IMAGE as what was on the left is now on the right and vice versa. In the left image, what was on the left (between $$-10$$ and $$-8$$) is still on the left between $$-2$$ and $$0$$.
