## FINAL REVIEW: MATERIAL
- ### More filter design
	- All-Pass filters: design, magnitude, phase
	- Impact of filter on a signal (lower frequencies vs. higher frequencies)
- ### Filter Design Structures and Realization Factors 
	- Tapped Delay Line (Direct Form)
	- Transpose of structures
	- IIR designs — direct form I and direct form II
	- Interpreting other designs, lattices, etc.
	- Cascading: Series and Parallel
	- Algebraic Stability Test 
		- Triangle of stability
- ### Windowing
	- What the choice of M does to a filter
	- Integral Square Error minimizing
	- Impact of windowing: Gibbs Phenomenon 
	- Window specifications
	- Other windows that can be used 
		- Rectangular (standard)
		- Hanning
		- Hamming
		- Blackman
	- Goals of window selection (narrower transition band, better stop-band)
- ### Specification based design
	- Tolerance definitions
	- Bilinear Transformation
		- Use to take known analog filters and create digital filters from them
		- Was important to preserve stability (left-hand of s-plane -> inside unit circle on z-plane) 
		- .$$j\Omega$$ axis of $$s$$-plane $$\leftrightarrow$$ unit circle of $$z$$-plane
		- Maps $$s\leftrightarrow{z}$$ and  $$\Omega\leftrightarrow\omega$$
		- Aside during this lecture: IIR cannot have linear phase
- ### IIR filters
	- Butterworth
	- Chebyshev I 
	- Chebyshev II 
	- Elliptic
	- Properties of each
	- Pole-zero plots of each
	- Using MATLAB to design IIR filters
	- `*ord` command
	- High pass, bandpass, bandstop
	- Frequency mapping (how to apply $$s$$-domain and $$z$$-domain frequency mappings)
- ### FIR equiripple design
	- __Advantage__: linear phase
	- Parks-McClellan needed — `firpm`
	- `firpmord`
	- MATLAB from HW
- ### Multirate DSP
	- Sampling chain review: anti-aliasing filter, A/D, filter, D/A, anti-imaging filter
	- Benefits of rate conversion being done digitally
	- Limitations of rate conversion being done digitally
	- Upsampling
	- Downsampling
	- Frequency domain impact of upsampling and downsampling, necessary filters, aliasing concerns, etc.
	- Interpolation techniques and efficient implementation 
	- A-D conversion: Quantization and Coding
	- Quantization error
- ### Misc:
	- Frequency resolution
	- Areas of concern and tradeoffs
