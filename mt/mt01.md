## SECTION 1:
__Signal manipulation and operations__
![fig01](mt01/mt01-fig01.png)

Use these plots for all of Setion 1 $$y[n]$$ is on the left and $$x[n]$$ is on the right.

### 1(a)
__Signal manipulation__: Plot the non-zero values of $$y_1[n]=-y[-4-2n]$$ where $$y[n]$$ is plotted on the left below.

### 1(b)
__Correlation__: again, use $$x[n]$$ and $$y[n]$$ as plotted above.

#### 1b(i)
List the indices, $$l$$, for which is $$r_{xy}[l]$$ non-zero (I'm not asking for a range and I don't care what the correlation values are.)

#### 1b(ii)
What is $$r_{yx}[-4]$$

### 1(c)
__Convolution__: $$z[n]$$ represents the convolution $$x[n]\otimes{y}[n]$$ with each plotted as shown.

#### 1c(i)
For which values of $$n$$ is $$z[n]$$ non-zero?

#### 1c(ii)
What is $$z[4]$$?

### 1(d)
__Operations__: Find $$w[n]=x[n+1]-y[n-5]$$. Be sure to label the value and range for $$w[n]$$.


## SECTION 2:
__Finite Length Operation, Energy/Power and Fundamental Period__

### 2(a)
__Circular time reversal and shift__: You are given the following sequence for $$ \begin{matrix}n=0:7&\left\{0,\:1,\:2,\:3,\:4,\:5,\:6,\:7\right\}\end{matrix}$$.

Recall, the circular time reversal is represented as this:
$$
\{y[n]\}=\{x[\left<-n\right>_8]\}
$$
and, the circular shift is represented as this:
$$
\{x_c[n]\}=\{x[\left<n-n_0\right>_8]\}
$$
We wish to combine these two operations into one and we define a circular shifted and refersed signal as:
$$
\{y_c[n]\}=\{x[\left<n-n_0\right>_8]\}
$$
For $$n_0=-13$$, list the $$8$$ values that are now in the slots $$n=0:7$$.


### 2(b)
__Energy/Power__

#### 2b(i)
Sketch the signal $$p[n]=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\delta[n-2k]}$$. Label appropriately enough so it is clear that you understand what this signal looks like.

#### 2b(ii)
Is $$p[n]$$, as described in __2b(i)__ , an energy signal or a power signal? If it is an energy signal, calculate the energy. If it is a powre signal, calculate the power.

### 2(c)
__Fundamental Period__: What is the fundamental period of the signal:
$$
x[n]=2\cos{\left(1.4\pi{n}\right)}-\sin{\left(1.2\pi{n}\right)}+\cos{\left(0.5\pi{n}\right)}
$$


## SECTION 3:
Discrete-Time Systems

### 3(a)
__Linear and Shift-Invariance__: For the signal $$y[n]=nx[n+2]+3$$

#### 3a(i)
Determine if the system is linear and justify your answer.

#### 3a(ii)
Determine if the system is shift-invariant and justify your answer.


### 3(b)
__Interconnected system__: YOu are told an LTI system has an impulse reponse
$$
h[n]=(h_1[n]\otimes{h}_2[n])-(h_3[n]\otimes{h}_4[n])
$$
You have access to system blocks labeled with the individual impulse responses, $$h_1[n]$$, $$h_2[n]$$, $$h_3[n]$$, and $$h_4[n]$$.  Draw a complete system to realize the impulse response as described.


### 3(c)
__Block Diagram Analysis__: Write the difference equation that describeds the block diagram below.

![]

### 3(d)
__Impulse Reponse__: For the block diagram in __3(c)__, write a mathematical expression (in terms of deltas and/or step functions) for the impulse response. This expression should NOT be recrusive — in other words, it should not include an $$h[n]$$ term. Assume $$\begin{matrix}y[n]=0&\text{for }n<0\end{matrix}$$.

### 3(e)
__Response to an input__: Assume you've determined the closed solution for the impulse response of an LTI system to be $$h[n]=\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^n\mu[n-2]$$. Determine a mathematical expression for the output, $$y[n]$$, for the input $$x[n]=\mu[n-1]$$. Simplify as much as possible. (This could prove more tedious than most of the other problems. If you are having trouble simplifying, set it up and explain what is happening as best you can. Understanding the set up and what is being asked is more important than being able to simplify to a final answer.)

### 3(f)
__Response to a new input__: An LTI system takes an input, $$x[n]$$, yields an output $$y[n]$$. In terms of $$y[n]$$, what is the output to $$x_1[n]=x[n]-x[n-4]$$.


## SECTION 4:
__Fourier Transforms, Properties and the Dirac Delta__

### 4(a)
__DTFT__: A colleague intends to show you the magnitude spectrum of the DTFT of a smpled signal. But, the page rips and all you can see is what between $$2\pi$$ and $$3\pi$$ as shown below. You also know that the original time-domain samples are real. Luckily you ahve seen enough.

#### 4a(i)
Plot the DTFT for $$\omega$$ ranging from $$-pi$$ to $$\pi$$.

#### 4a(ii)
Is this a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter or a bandpass filter?

### 4(b)
__Convolution using the DTFT__: An input, $$x[n]$$, is put into an LTI system and results in an output with the following DTFT:
$$
Y\left(e^{j\omega}\right)=6e^{-j2\omega}+2e^{-j3\omega}+4e^{-j4\omega}
$$
THis impulse response of the system is $$\begin{matrix}h[n]=\{3,\:1,\:2\}&\text{for }n=0:2\end{matrix}$$. Write an expression for the input, $$x[n]$$, that results in the above output.

### 4(c)
__Dirac Delta__: Reduce $$\delta\left(\tfrac{1}{3}t-1\right)[t^3-2t]$$


## SECTION 5:
__Sampling__

### 5(a)
__Sampling a CT signal__: Assume you have a signal $$x(t)=4t-3$$ and you decide to sample at a sampling frequency of $$8\:\text{Hz}$$ to create the signal $$x[n]$$. What is $$x[4]$$?

### 5(b)
__Sampling a sinusoid__: The following figure depicts $$x(t)=\cos{\left(2\pi(2)t\right)}$$ being sampled to produce the discrete-time signal $$x[n]$$. You can trust your eyes, if the amplitudes look the same, they are the same.

#### 5b(i)
What is the sampling period, $$T$$?

#### 5b(ii)
What is the period of the discrete-time signal, $$x[n]$$?

### 5(c)
__Sampling/Aliasing__: An engineer has a device that generates siganls up to $$5\:\text{Hz}$$ that she wishes to sample.


#### 5c(i)
She determines the lowest possible sampling rate (according to Nyquist) to be able to adequately reconstruct the device's signals after sampling and adds a buffer of $$3\:\text{Hz}$$—to be safe. What sampling rate does she use?

#### 5c(ii)
Assume the sampling rate you found in __5c(i)__ is used here. Later, it is learned that a spurious signal, specifically, $$\sin{\left(2\pi(9)t\right)}$$ is generated by the sampler and will unavoidably be added to any signal that is beign sampled.  The engineer has an option in her device that allows her to add sinusoids of any magnitude or frequency up to $$5\:\text{Hz}$$. What exact signal, $$g(t)$$, shoud our clever engineer purosely add to any outgoing signal with the goal of canceling the sampled version of the spurious signal?


#### 5c(iii)
The engineer's system is now locked down and she is committed to adding the $$g(t)$$ that you found in __5c(ii)__ to all of her signals. Unfortunately, she now learns that the spurious signal being unavoidably added to each signal is NOT $$\sin{\left(2\pi(9)t\right)}$$. Name two spurious signals (with any magnitude and with a frequency above $$5\:\text{Hz}$$) that will allow the engineer to be happy that her design from __5c(ii)__ will still work to cancel the spurious signal.
