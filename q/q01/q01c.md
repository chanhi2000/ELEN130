A discrete-time sequence, $$x[n]$$, is defined to have non-zero positive values from $$n=-1:2$$. $$y[n]=x[n]\otimes{x}[n]$$. At what values of $$n$$ do non-zero values appear in $$y[n]$$ (*i.e.* what is the range of $$y[n]$$)?


Assume some values for $$x[n]$$. Then, to compute the convolution, we can construct a table as following:

| $$n$$ | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| $$x[n]$$ | 0 | A | B | C | D | 0 |
| flipped $$x[n]$$ | D | C | B | A | 0 | 0 |

- To yield the "first" non-zero value of the convolution
	- shift __left__ by 2
- To yield the "last" non-zero value of the convolution
	- shift __right__ by 4

Thus, $$x[n]$$ has a range such that,
$$
\therefore\:-2\leq{n}\leq4.
$$
And the length is
$$
(4)-(2)+1=7;
$$
