__Circular convolution with DFT__:
Assume you wish to calculate the circular convolution of two sequences by taking their DFTs, multiplying them and then taking the inverse DFT.  To waht length should $$x[n]$$ and or $$h[n]$$ be zero-padded to if 
$$
\begin{align*}
x[n]&=[1,\:2,\:3,\:4,\:5,\:6,\:7]\\
h[n]&=[1,\:2,\:3,\:4,\:5]
\end{align*}
$$


Circular convolution through the DFT/IDFT method requires both sequences to be zero-padded to the length of __the longer sequence__. 

So, in this case,
 - .$$x[n]$$ stays the same and 
 - .$$h[n]$$ must be zero-padded to length $$7$$.
