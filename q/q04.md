## 1. 
__MATLAB step size__: You have calculated the frequency response of a signal using MATLAB's `freqz()` command — specifically, you have typed:
```matlab
[H w]=freqz(x, 1, 512, 'whole')
```
What is the step size between the locations of the samples on the w-axis?


## 2.
You are given the following pole/zero plot. Draw a reasonable sketch of the magnitude of the frequency response. Use a frequency axis that goes from $$-\pi$$ to $$\pi$$.

## 3.
A system has a transfer function of:
$$
H(z)=\frac{z-2}{2z+1}
$$
What is the difference equation that describes this system — write it as a causal system in the form $$y[n]=$$?
