## 1.
__MATLAB step size__: You have calculated the frequency response of a signal using MATLAB's `freqz()` command â€” specifically, you have typed:
```matlab
[H w]=freqz(x, 1, 512, 'whole')
```
What is the step size between the locations of the samples on the `w`-axis?


The step size for the range of $$2\pi$$ covered with $$N$$ step is
$$
\begin{align*}
\omega&=2\pi\frac{1}{N}\\
&=2\pi\frac{1}{512}\\
&=\frac{\pi}{256}
\end{align*}
$$
