Useful equations regarding stability — we desire
$$
\begin{align*}
|d_2|&<1,\\
|d_1|&<1+d_2
\end{align*}
$$
It's up to you to have remembered what $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$ are.

## 1.
You are given the transfer function
$$
H(z)=\frac{z^{-2}}{2-1.8z^{-1}+az^{-2}}
$$
Determine the range of coefficient $$a$$ to preserve stability.

This transfer function does not follow our usual form for one main reason — make sure you account for this and/or get it into the required form before continuing.  If this does not make sense or you do not know what I'm talking about, either proceed (and possibly lose a point) or ask me and I'll tell you for the cost of one point.


## 2.
You have access to two filters:
- Filter $$A_H$$ is an HPF with a cutoff of $$\tfrac{1}{4}\pi$$.
- Filter $$B_H$$ is an HPF with a cutoff of $$\tfrac{3}{4}\pi$$.

Combine the filters algebraically (similar to how you did in HW7) to create a bandpass filter that only passes frequencies between $$\tfrac{1}{4}\pi$$ and $$\tfrac{3}{4}\pi$$


## 3.
In HW6, you found that the transfer function for a rectangular window, $$\begin{matrix}w_1[n]=1,&0\leq{n}\leq{N}\end{matrix}$$, is as follows:
$$
W_1(z)=\frac{z^{(N+1)}-1}{z^{N}(z-1)}
$$
Plot the pole-zero plot for a rectangular window of length $$5$$. For 1 point of extra credit, determine the main lobe width of the filter.
