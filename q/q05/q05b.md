## 2.
You have access to two filters:
- Filter $$A_H$$ is an HPF with a cutoff of $$\tfrac{1}{4}\pi$$.
- Filter $$B_H$$ is an HPF with a cutoff of $$\tfrac{3}{4}\pi$$.

Combine the filters algebraically (similar to how you did in HW7) to create a bandpass filter that only passes frequencies between $$\tfrac{1}{4}\pi$$ and $$\tfrac{3}{4}\pi$$

$$
A_H-B_h
$$
will provide the bandpass filter of choice. Specifically
- Filter $$A_H$$ passses anyting above $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$ and
- Filter $$B_H$$ passes anything above $$\frac{3\pi}{4}$$
So $$A_H-B_h$$ will preserve the area from $$\frac{\pi}{4}$$ to $$\frac{3\pi}{4}$$ and block everything else.
